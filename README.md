# Sakila_Database_Procedures
Working with a Mysql sample database, this project provides basic functionality for the dataset with stored procedures. Procedures include inserting into multiple tables with foreign key restrictions, searches that join multiple tables,  and some miscellaneous functions.  


create_tables.sql and sakila-data.sql comes with mysql as a sample relational database. To use procedures first run the create_tables.sql file in your mysql implimentation, I used XAMPP in my instance, followed by inserting the data with sakila-data.sql

The database is setup to run off localhost and has default 'root' credentials.
